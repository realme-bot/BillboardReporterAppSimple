# Billboard Reporter App

## Introduction

The Billboard Reporter App is a React-based application designed to **fetch, display, and report Billboard data efficiently**.  
The project provides a user-friendly interface for viewing Billboard information, while securely handling API keys.

## Problem Statement

Many developers or small teams working with public APIs often **hardcode API keys in their source code**, which can lead to **security risks** if the repository is public. Additionally, managing and presenting Billboard data in a clean, interactive way can be challenging without a structured app.

## What This Project Solves

- **Secure API Usage:** Demonstrates the proper use of environment variables to store API keys instead of hardcoding them.  
- **Data Reporting:** Fetches Billboard data from APIs and presents it in a clear, interactive interface.  
- **Easy Setup:** Provides a ready-to-run React application with minimal configuration.  
- **Educational Value:** Serves as an example of best practices for handling secrets in GitHub and React projects.
